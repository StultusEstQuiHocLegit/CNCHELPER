### ‚öôÔ∏è In the following, you can see the base prompts with which the main code base in this repository was created





Please create a website, where there is a page with horizontal and vertical lines with opacity 0.3 as a canva in the background, backgroudn color should be lighgrey,
in the bottom left corner there is a switch for mm and inch, mm by default, if user switches, save if as a cookie for ten years, on page onload, toggle it based on cookie if there is one,
in the top right corner there should be a small download button to download the svg-files,
in the top left corner there should be a button for text and for upload,
the user can upload svg, png, jpeg, jpg, if its svg, we just put it on the canva,
if it's another file, we have to convert it in svg first,
in both cases, make the images only black and white and keep only the black parts as paths, the white backgroudn we don't need,
the user can arrange texts and images on the canva, can scroll in and out,
in the bottom right corner there are the dimension, by default 1m x 1m widht and height, also save cookies for them too and load them if set
at the side of the canva, there should be the size written down on x- and y-axis, the horizontal and vertical should be in a regular grid,
based on scrolling level for example in distances of 5mm, 10mm, 20mm, 50mm, ...
the user can resize texts and images, turn them (locking in on for example 5¬∞, 10¬∞, ...), reposition them (there shoudl be locking in, so for example if it's nearly the same height, put it the same height,
if its neraly centered, center it, ..., also lock in relativ to each other and stuff),
with crtl-Z and ctrl-y he can go back and furth, with crtl-s he triggers pressing the download button
the user can click on a text and change it, while he edits a text, above the text there should be a little font icon, by clicking on it, he can select a font, please give 30 options in different styles, default shoudl be Arial, set cookie for that one too,
if the uer clicks on an image, there shoudl appear a little drill icon above, if he clicks it, the color is changed from black (default for all texts and image paths) to orange, of he clicks again, we go back,
all black is "engraving" all orange is "cutting", on download, please export two svg files:
1.) only hte blakc parts all in one file: TRAMANNPROJECTS_CNCHELPER_engraving_[InsertWidth]_[InsertHeight]_[mm or inch]_[UnsertCurrentDateAndTimeWithUnderscores]
2.) only the orange parts all in one file: TRAMANNPROJECTS_CNCHELPER_cutting_[InsertWidth]_[InsertHeight]_[mm or inch]_[UnsertCurrentDateAndTimeWithUnderscores]
(if one of the files is empty, we don't need to download that)
please also allos the user to select multiple things and move them around, turn them, ... all at once,
if user wants to leave page before downloading / has "un-downloaded" chagnes, rememebr him to save, but don't do that if he has nothign entered yet

Please also add next to "Upload Image", right next to it "Add Form" and on click a small menu open where the user can select:
line, rectangle (filled out), rectangle (just the ouline), triangle (filled out), triangle (just the ouline), circle (filled out), circle (just the ouline), star (filled out), star (just the ouline)
and also some ohter common form you find usefull, add about 20 more after these

Please also add right next to "Add Form" a distance measurement tool where the user can select two point and then a line is drawn in between and on this line there is the distance written,
then the user can click again and this third clicks is the beginnign of the second line (keep the old lines and measurement information there), the the measurement tool is activated
until ESC key on keyboard is pressed or until the user unselects the button at the top, then also all distance lines and measurement informations are gone
